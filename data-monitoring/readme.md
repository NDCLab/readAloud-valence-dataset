# Data Monitoring

This folder contains:
* **data-monitoring-log.md**: A log of data monitoring activities run.
* **postprocessing-check/**: Scripts for testing future post-processing. Note that code is being placed here, not in “code/” because this is ad-hoc code used for checking data, not formal code used to reformat/preprocess data. Actual postprocessing code and outputs must be placed in the associated analysis repository.
* **results-check/**: Scripts, statistics, and visualizations for testing future outputs. Note that code is being placed here, not in “code/” because this is ad-hoc code used for checking data, not formal code used to reformat/preprocess data. Actual results code and outputs must be placed in the associated analysis repository.


The data monitoring protocol is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15yY9PetZN9KQJswAEBoEVIgiTGkcekI8hmUCne4WVGM/edit?usp=sharing).
