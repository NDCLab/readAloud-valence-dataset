"The Great Depression was a severe economic recession that had devastating, worldwide consequences. On October 29 of 1929, dubbed “Black Tuesday,” billions of dollars were lost and some investors were totally bankrupted. In the United States, unemployment shot up to 23%. It was especially hard on farmers in the Great Plains, who suffered a decline in crop prices and a punishing drought that crippled their economy. Herbert Hoover became president just before the crash and was long scorned for his refusal to involve the federal government in relief efforts.

As the situation grew more dire across the country, the talented Franklin Delano Roosevelt came to power. He quickly launched a series of creative resolutions designed to provide economic relief and steer the country toward recovery. The most popular was the Civilian Conservation Corps, a volunteer program that offered employment to young men and sought to improve national morale. CCC projects, such as building bridges and roads, focused on the preservation and improvement of the land and its natural resources. Two national parks – Big Bend and The Great Smoky Mountains – were almost completely built by CCC volunteers. The program successfully planted 3.5 billion trees and created 711 state parks.",Which president created the Civilian Conservation Corps?,a. ,Herbert Hoover,b. ,Theodore Roosevelt,c. ,Franklin Delano Roosevelt,d. ,Harry Truman,c,"Dolphins are highly-intelligent sea creatures who mostly prefer warmer, tropical waters.  A thick layer of blubber helps with buoyancy and serves to streamline their flexible bodies.  They have excellent hearing, which is adapted for both air and water.  Sociable and playful, dolphins live in pods of up to a dozen individuals.  In Greek mythology, dolphins were esteemed as the helpers of humankind.  Seeing dolphins swimming in the wake of a ship was considered a good omen by the Ancient Greeks and many ancient coins pictured a young man riding on the back of a dolphin.

Over the past several decades, the devastating decline in the dolphin population has been the cause of grave alarm.  This precipitous drop has been provoked by many factors, particularly noise pollution.  Noise pollution refers to the underwater sounds of boat traffic, torpedo testing, and offshore drilling.  All this unnatural noise is very stressful to dolphins.  It interferes with how they navigate and can even prove fatal: in some cases, dolphins rush to the surface to avoid all the racket.  Surfacing too hastily can cause decompression sickness, an illness induced by dissolved nitrogen in the body and which can lead to paralysis and death.",What is the typical size of dolphin pods as mentioned in the text?,a. ,2,b. ,12,c. ,20,d. ,100,b
"The mantis shrimp is a puny but aggressive crustacean who works alone and leaves its solitary burrow merely to hunt. There are two categories of mantis shrimp. “Spearers” have pointy, barbed forelimbs that they use to stab and snag their prey. “Smashers” bludgeon their victims with an oversized, club-like appendage. This terrifying weapon strikes at the same velocity as a gunshot; it is so fast that it makes bubbles in the water around the unfortunate adversary. The mantis shrimp’s poor victim is hit twice: first by the claw and then by the shockwave, either of which is deadly.

The need to dominate in close-range combat may be the origin of the most amazing and elaborate visual system ever discovered. Two eyeballs are mounted on stalks and move independently of each other; each eyeball also has its own trinocular vision. Together, these visual advantages provide the mantis shrimp with excellent depth perception. What’s more, some species of mantis shrimp have 16 types of photoreceptor cells, giving them the power to perceive an immense rainbow of color, from deep ultraviolet to far red. Many mantis shrimp are brightly colored themselves, such as the attractive and prized peacock mantis. These crustaceans use color like a special language during mating rituals, actively illuminating themselves in vibrant, fluorescent colors that only other mantis shrimp can see.",Which is thought to be the reason why mantis shrimp have great depth perception?,a. ,They are colorblind.,b. ,They attack prey in close-range.,c. ,They use depth to find a mate.,d. ,They have eyes on their claws.,b,"A dam is a gateway that is designed to direct the flow of water. The first known dam was built in Jordan over 5000 years ago. An important ambition in the construction of a dam is to provide sufficient water, both for drinking and for cultivating local farmland. In modern history, this water has also been employed for its hydropower capabilities and dams have become a significant generator of electricity. Humans build these structures, but so do beavers. Using tree branches and vegetation to form their quirky lodges, beavers create an infrastructure that contributes positively to local wetlands.

Dams are an incredible invention. When they fail, the consequences can be catastrophic. Sudden flooding can lead to costly damage to buildings and even death in the nearby population. Failures are typically caused by a poor design leading to a structural breach. The risk of disastrous flooding is not the only downside to dams. New dams drastically degrade rivers, causing the loss of entire ecosystems and the endangered species who occupy them. For example, the Chinese river dolphin was forced into extinction in part due to construction of the Three Gorges Dam. It is not always apparent whether the benefits of dams are adequate to outweigh their destructive repercussions.",Which of the following is NOT mentioned by the text as a purpose for dam construction?,a. ,drinking water,b. ,water for farmland,c. ,lake creation,d. ,electricity,c
