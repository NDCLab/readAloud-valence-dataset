Air travel today is very efficient, carrying jetsetters from one side of the globe to the other in a matter of hours. In the Sixties, however, traveling by airplane was a glamorous affair. Passengers got dressed up, the in-flight hospitality was luxurious, and everyone had lots of legroom. During this Golden Age of flying, champagne flowed freely at the bar and the guests were served lobster. It was like a cocktail party in the sky. With no one puking in the seat next to you or hogging the armrest.

In the Seventies, deregulation triggered pricing wars that caused service levels to plummet. Under the strain of fierce competition, airlines were forced to shove more bodies into each flight and to cram more flights into each day. Airports became hectic and airplanes cramped. Now, any minor disruption to the schedule causes insufferable delays and the entire ordeal is a relentless assault on oneâ€™s patience.
