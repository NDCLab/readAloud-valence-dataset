The great horned owl is a nocturnal bird native to the Americas. It is easily recognized by its tufted feather “horns,” called plumicorns, and its large, yellow eyes. A symbol of strength, courage, and beauty, the great horned owl has an unmistakable hoot, four to five syllables in length. Special feathers allow it to fly soundlessly through the twilight as it skillfully seeks its next meal, often a rabbit or a hare. A surprising victim of this formidable predator is the skunk. 

The skunk advertises its smelly defense with warning stripes down its back. If provoked, it sprays a foul liquid that can cause temporary blindness in its careless and unfortunate adversary. The odor has been described as a combination of musk, garlic, burning sulfur, and sewer gas. This stinky weapon is so revolting that the skunk has very few predators, making the owl a notable exception.
