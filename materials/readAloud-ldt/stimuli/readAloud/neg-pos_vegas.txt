Las Vegas was founded in the early twentieth century, but 1931 was the critical year in its urban development. The fledgling metropolis legalized casino gambling and dropped the minimum residency for divorce to six weeks. That year also marked the start of construction on the nearby Hoover Dam whose influx of laborers enabled Vegas to avoid catastrophe during the Depression. In the Fifties, before testing moved underground, nuclear weapons were detonated only 65 miles from downtown.

Known as “Sin City,” Vegas has long been infamous for vice and varied illicit pursuits. Pleasure and entertainment have made the city’s reputation, and it has been popular for its lavish hotels and celebrity performances since the Forties. But it was first famous for the abundant wild grasses and natural spring water available in this beautiful desert valley. Named “The Meadows” by Spanish explorers, Vegas was a “resort” town before any were built with neon. Travelers could refuel in the valley on their journey westward. Today, Vegas is its own destination, made easy to schedule with its average of 310 sunny days each year.
