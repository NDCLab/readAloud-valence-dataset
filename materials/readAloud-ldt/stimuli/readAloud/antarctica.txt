The first expedition to the South Pole was led by an explorer from the newly independent country of Norway. In the southern hemisphere, springtime occurs in October, so the courageous Norwegian team of five men and 52 dogs set off from their camp in mid-October 1911, hoping to reach the geographic South Pole. Skilled on skis, they traveled for two months and arrived, safe and sound, by mid-December. Victorious, they returned to civilization, pleased to have triumphed over the British expedition. The British team embarked on a similar quest via a different route with a fatal conclusion.

Five weeks after the Norwegians conquered the Pole, the British arrived. They were severely disappointed to find a letter left by the Norwegians to confirm their defeat. Dejected, they turned back, planning to meet a support team in early March around Latitude 82, but the team never appeared. Suffering from frostbite and running out of food, they waited in the merciless cold just 12 miles from their main supply point. Violent storms raged outside their tent and suspicion crept in that they had been abandoned. Their pursuit of the Pole ended in grim misfortune.
