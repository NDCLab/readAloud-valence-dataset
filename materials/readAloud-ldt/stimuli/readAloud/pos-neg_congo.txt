Six percent of the Earthâ€™s surface is blanketed in rainforest. From the temperate forests of the Pacific Northwest to the tropical Congo, these evergreen canopies are the longest-living ecosystems on the planet. They are also a refuge of diversity, serving as home to a wealth of plant and animal species.

People have inhabited rainforests for thousands of years. Today, more than 75 million people live in the Congo Basin. These residents have witnessed as tragedy unfolds, destroying the fragile woods they inhabit. Both industrial logging and slash-and-burn agriculture, where sections of trees are cut down and then burned to cultivate crops, have led to major deforestation in the region. Deforestation has made the area more accessible to commercial hunters, igniting a poaching epidemic that is killing off midsize animals faster than they can reproduce. And social unrest means that the dangers of ambush, kidnapping, and robbery remain high in some areas.
