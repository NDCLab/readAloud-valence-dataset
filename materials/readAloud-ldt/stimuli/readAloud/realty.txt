Buying a home is an exciting endeavor. Although it is a major financial commitment, it offers the opportunity to build your credit and grow your equity for the long-term. Selecting the right real estate agent is crucial since this person will advocate on your behalf during the negotiation process. You also want to secure a low interest rate.

In a hot market, it is important to know what you can afford so that your home-buying adventure sidesteps foreclosure. If you overextend yourself, you may fall behind on your monthly loan payments. Don’t forget that you don’t just have a mortgage to pay, you also have taxes and insurance, not to mention the cost of upkeep and any necessary repairs. Debt can make some people anxious, so budget appropriately. Ultimately, the stress of managing a mortgage is not so different from that of being a tenant. Just now the landlord is you.
