The grizzly is a subspecies of the brown bear, notorious for its aggressive tendencies. Weighing over four hundred pounds, grizzlies use their formidable size to frighten opponents. If size fails to terrify, their long claws and fearsome bite can inflict considerable damage. Their claws are four inches long and the grizzly jaw is strong enough to crack a bowling ball.

With a varied diet, the grizzly has a reputation for hunting in waterfalls. Salmon jump these changes in elevation and bears are excellent fishermen. The rise of ecotourism has made bear-watching a fashionable activity and the skill of the bear in salmon fishing is a consistent favorite. Salmon are rich in the nutrients that are needed to prepare for hibernation, especially for females. Mother bears give birth to cubs in their winter dens and their autumn meals must provide them with enough strength until the spring.
