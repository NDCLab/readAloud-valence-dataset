Even on frozen lakes and rivers, anglers can catch all kinds of interesting and edible fish. Before selecting a desirable location, these intrepid fishermen confirm that the ice is strong enough with a handy rhyme: “Thick and blue, tried and true.” This ensures that the ice is safe to walk on.

Ice fishing is an inexpensive sport as you only need a handful of tools and a warm set of clothes to spend several enjoyable hours fishing without frostbite. With a saw or chisel, you drill a hole in the ice; alternately, you cut through it with an axe. Next you must remove the slush. Some anglers just drop in a hook and line, and wait. Others linger over the hole, on the lookout for a target, ready to plunge a spear into the frigid brine. In some places, the ice is dotted with shanties because anglers have constructed narrow shacks to stave off the cold.
