Lumens measure light emission. The human eyeball is unable to stare at anything discharging too many lumens, which is why a partial solar eclipse is so hazardous and deceptive. The parts of the Sun not obstructed by the Moon are just as blinding as they are on a typical day. In the blackout, the pupil dilates and each exposed cell on the retina is assaulted by rays of light. This literal “sunburn” causes lesions, inflicting irreversible damage.

Dangerous and destructive, sunshine is still the most important source of energy for life on Earth. The Sun fuses 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second and radiates that energy as sunlight. Solar power technology transforms this energy into a renewable source of electricity. The first solar thermal power station was built in Egypt in 1913 and the largest solar power plant in the world today glimmers in the Californian desert. Rooftop solar panels empower individuals to harness the power of the Sun.



Question: Why are partial solar eclipses dangerous?
The pupil dilates too far, causing damage.
The unblocked sunlight burns the retina.
The Sun discharges more lumens during an eclipse.
