victim of this formidable predator is the skunk. 

The skunk advertises its smelly defense with warning stripes down its back. If provoked, it sprays a foul liquid that can cause temporary blindness in its careless and unfortunate adversary. The odor has been described as a combination of musk, garlic, burning sulfur, and sewer gas. This stinky weapon is so revolting that the skunk has very few predators, making the owl a notable exception.
