sunshine is still the most important source of energy for life on Earth. The Sun fuses 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second and radiates that energy as sunlight. Solar power technology transforms this energy into a renewable source of electricity. The first solar thermal power station was built in Egypt in 1913 and the largest solar power plant in the world today glimmers in the Californian desert. Rooftop solar panels empower individuals to harness the power of the Sun.
