fatal conclusion.

Five weeks after the Norwegians conquered the Pole, the British arrived. They were severely disappointed to find a letter left by the Norwegians to confirm their defeat. Dejected, they turned back, planning to meet a support team in early March around Latitude 82, but the team never appeared. Suffering from frostbite and running out of food, they waited in the merciless cold just 12 miles from their main supply point. Violent storms raged outside their tent and suspicion crept in that they had been abandoned. Their pursuit of the Pole ended in grim misfortune.
