magical, chewy confection.

There are all kinds of caramels: crunchy brittles, jiggly flans, ice cream drizzles, and soft squares that simply melt on your tongue. A more recent trend in caramel is the addition of sea salt. First invented by a French pastry chef in 1977, salted caramel became a worldwide craze around 2008. Scientists have found that the combination of sugar, butter, and salt creates a reward cycle that makes you crave the candy even more after every bite.
