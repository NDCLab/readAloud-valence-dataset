fail, the consequences can be catastrophic. Sudden flooding can lead to costly damage to buildings and even death in the nearby population. Failures are typically caused by a poor design leading to a structural breach. The risk of disastrous flooding is not the only downside to dams. New dams drastically degrade rivers, causing the loss of entire ecosystems and the endangered species who occupy them. For example, the Chinese river dolphin was forced into extinction in part due to construction of the Three Gorges Dam. It is not always apparent whether the benefits of dams are adequate to outweigh their destructive repercussions.
