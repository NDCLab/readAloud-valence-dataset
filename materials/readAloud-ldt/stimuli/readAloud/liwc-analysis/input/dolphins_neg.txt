devastating decline in the dolphin population has been the cause of grave alarm.  This precipitous drop has been provoked by many factors, particularly noise pollution.  Noise pollution refers to the underwater sounds of boat traffic, torpedo testing, and offshore drilling.  All this unnatural noise is very stressful to dolphins.  It interferes with how they navigate and can even prove fatal: in some cases, dolphins rush to the surface to avoid all the racket.  Surfacing too hastily can cause decompression sickness, an illness induced by dissolved nitrogen in the body and which can lead to paralysis and death.
