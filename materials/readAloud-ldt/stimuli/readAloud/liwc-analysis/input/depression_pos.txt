talented Franklin Delano Roosevelt rose to power. He quickly launched a series of creative resolutions designed to provide economic relief and steer the country toward recovery. The most popular was the Civilian Conservation Corps, a volunteer program that offered employment to young men and sought to improve national morale. CCC projects, such as building bridges and roads, focused on the preservation and improvement of the land and its natural resources. Two national parks – Big Bend and The Great Smoky Mountains – were almost completely built by CCC volunteers. The program successfully planted 3.5 billion trees and created 711 state parks.
