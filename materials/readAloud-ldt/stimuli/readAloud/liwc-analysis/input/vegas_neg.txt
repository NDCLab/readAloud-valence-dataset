Las Vegas was founded in the early twentieth century, but 1931 was the critical year in its urban development. The fledgling metropolis legalized casino gambling and dropped the minimum residency for divorce to six weeks. That year also marked the start of construction on the nearby Hoover Dam and the influx of laborers enabled Vegas to avoid catastrophe during the Depression. In the Fifties, before testing moved underground, nuclear weapons were detonated only 65 miles from downtown.

Known as “Sin City,” Vegas has long been infamous for vice and varied illicit pursuits.
