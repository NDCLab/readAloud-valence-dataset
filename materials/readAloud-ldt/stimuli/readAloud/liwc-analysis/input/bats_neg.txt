death, darkness, and witchcraft. Most microbats hunt on insects, but not vampire bats. There are only three species of vampire bat, all of which are blood suckers. Under the cover of darkness, they use infrared radiation to locate blood hotspots on their sleeping prey and attack from the ground, approaching on all fours. With razor sharp teeth, they make a small bite and spend about thirty minutes draining the wound. Their saliva prevents the blood from clotting. Although itâ€™s creepy, the victim does not lose enough blood to do them harm.
