amazing and elaborate visual system ever discovered. Two eyeballs are mounted on stalks and move independently of each other; each eyeball also has its own trinocular vision. Together, these visual advantages provide the mantis shrimp with excellent depth perception. Whatâ€™s more, some species of mantis shrimp have 16 types of photoreceptor cells, giving them the power to perceive an immense rainbow of color, from deep ultraviolet to far red. Many mantis shrimp are brightly colored themselves, such as the attractive and prized peacock mantis. These crustaceans use color like a special language during mating rituals, actively illuminating themselves in vibrant, fluorescent colors that only other mantis shrimp can see.
