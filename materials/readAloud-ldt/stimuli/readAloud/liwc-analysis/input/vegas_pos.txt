Pleasure and entertainment have made the city’s reputation, and it has been popular for its lavish hotels and celebrity performances since the Forties. But it was first famous for the abundant wild grasses and natural spring water available in this beautiful desert valley. Named “The Meadows” by Spanish explorers, Vegas was a “resort” town before any were built with neon. Travelers could refuel in the valley on their journey westward. Today, Vegas is its own destination, made easy to schedule with its average of 310 sunny days each year.
