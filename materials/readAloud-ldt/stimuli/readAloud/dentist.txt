Tooth decay and gum disease are infections that can increase your risk for diabetes and heart trouble. This is why regular dental appointments are critical. But some people are terrified of going to the dentist. This fear of drills, needles, and oral pain can cause those who suffer from it to avoid the dentist. Ironically, this only inflates the probability of cavities and other dental problems.

Dentists need to have compassion for all their patients. Have you ever noticed how friendly and talkative everyone is when you go in for your annual cleaning? While they shine up your pearly whites, they calm you with conversation. You always rise from the chair with minty fresh breath and exciting, new knowledge of your hygienistâ€™s personal life. The American Dental Association recommends that you get your teeth cleaned at least once every year.
