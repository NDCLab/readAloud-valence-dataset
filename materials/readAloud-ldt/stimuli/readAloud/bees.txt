Colony collapse disorder has been documented since 1869. Although its cause is still unidentified, its symptoms are manifest: a hive is abandoned by its bees, leaving behind the honey and the queen. It is currently speculated that colony collapse disorder is triggered by the interplay of multiple stressors, such as parasites, pesticides, and an inadequate diet. These rampant fears about colony collapse disorder concern one particular strain of bee that prospers worldwide, on every continent.

There are 20,000 known species of bee around the globe, of which eight make honey. Honey is produced from the nectar of flowers and is stored in honeycomb. A single beehive can generate more than 60 pounds of honey each year. This liquid confection is, of course, sweet and delicious, but it can also be employed for therapeutic purposes, especially as a topical antibiotic in herbal medicine.
