Making caramel is a risky undertaking. Particles of sucrose and glucose are heated until they brown, then combined with fat to yield a sticky, elastic substance. The primary dangers are splatter and seizing, both of which threaten the moment that cold fat hits scalding sucrose. If the boiling mixture touches skin, it adheres and burns the flesh. If the mixture seizes, you are left with clumps of hard, useless sugar. If nothing goes wrong, then the consequence of this difficult process is a magical, chewy confection. There are all kinds of caramels: crunchy brittles, jiggly flans, ice cream drizzles, and soft squares that simply melt on your tongue. A more recent trend in caramel is the addition of sea salt. First invented by a French pastry chef in 1977, salted caramel became a worldwide craze around 2008. Scientists have found that the combination of sugar, butter, and salt creates a reward cycle that makes you crave the candy even more after every bite.
