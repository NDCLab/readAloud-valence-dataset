Bats are the only flying mammal. The smallest has a six-inch wingspan; the wings of the largest, the flying foxes, extend over one and a half meters. Microbats send out ultrasonic sounds that produce echoes. The returning echoes allow them to “see” in their nightly quest for food. A different kind of bat, the megabat, eats fruit, which it finds with its senses of smell and vision.

Across Asia and the Pacific, there are strong positive cultural associations with this furry, winged creature. In the West, it is popularly connected to death, darkness, and witchcraft. Most microbats hunt on insects, but not vampire bats. There are only three species of vampire bat, all of which are blood suckers. Under the cover of darkness, they use infrared radiation to locate blood hotspots on their sleeping prey and attack from the ground, approaching on all fours. With razor sharp teeth, they make a small bite and spend about thirty minutes draining the wound. Their saliva prevents the blood from clotting. Although it’s creepy, the victim does not lose enough blood to do them harm.
