Dog shows, also called breed shows, are controversial. Some argue that they are detrimental to the welfare of the breed because, by selecting for shallow characteristics, they weaken genetics and engender abnormalities. This focus on the superficial, they contend, leads to disease, from which many competitors suffer. For example, pugs are bred with shortened skulls for the infamous squashed muzzle. But this distortion of the skull causes respiratory troubles and bulging eyeballs that are prone to injury.

At a show, contestants are judged not against each other but against the standards for their breed. Those that conform to these standards take the prize, which is simply a point toward a championship title. These points demonstrate that a particular puppy has been found to be a superior example of its breed. In theory, this indicates that the dog has an ideal appearance and is in excellent health. Breed standards often use terms like “alert,” “intelligent,” and “energetic” because the intent is to maintain the integrity of the breed. Pups are carefully groomed for shows and prance around the ring to show off their stellar physique. Show training is intense and requires lots of love and determination to teach a dog how to bring home the gold.
