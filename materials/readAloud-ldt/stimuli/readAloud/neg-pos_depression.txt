The Great Depression was a severe economic recession that had devastating, worldwide consequences. On October 29 of 1929, dubbed “Black Tuesday,” billions of dollars were lost and some investors were totally bankrupted. In the United States, unemployment shot up to 23%. It was especially hard on farmers in the Great Plains, who suffered a decline in crop prices and a punishing drought that crippled their economy. Herbert Hoover became president just before the crash and was long scorned for his refusal to involve the federal government in relief efforts.

As the situation grew more dire across the country, the talented Franklin Delano Roosevelt came to power. He quickly launched a series of creative resolutions designed to provide economic relief and steer the country toward recovery. The most popular was the Civilian Conservation Corps, a volunteer program that offered employment to young men and sought to improve national morale. CCC projects, such as building bridges and roads, focused on the preservation and improvement of the land and its natural resources. Two national parks – Big Bend and The Great Smoky Mountains – were almost completely built by CCC volunteers. The program successfully planted 3.5 billion trees and created 711 state parks.
